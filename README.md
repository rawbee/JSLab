# JavaScript 101

#### I know JavaScript - Show me!

JavaScript is a **real language**. Although it started as a language for building websites, it has since grown to be used on the server, to build native mobile apps, automate other programs (like Photoshop), and just about anything that can run code. It is also very approachable, forgiving, and well documented.

JavaScript was introduced by [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) in 1995 for Netscape Communications to add some interactivity to websites.

## Running JavaScript

There are many ways to run JavaScript code, but one of the easiest ways is in to use an online tool like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), which we'll use in this class.

<!-- slide : codepen -->

## Basic syntax

JavaScript is **case-sensitive**. **Lines end by semicolon `;`**. **Blocks are delimited curly brackets by `{ }`**. Comments are between **`/* */` for multiple lines** or after **`//` for one line**.

`var myVariable` is different from `var MyVariable`.

`var myVariable = 'hello'; myVariable = 'goodbye'` is two statements--the value of `myVariable` will be `goodbye`

```javascript
var myVariable = "hello"; // this is a comment and will be ignored when JavaScript runs
```

```javascript
/*
  this is a comment and 
  will be ignored when JavaScript runs
*/
var myVariable = "hello";
```

## Variables & Types

A variable is just a place to store a value, like a locker. Values in JavaScript fall into a few primitive types; the most common being Numbers and Strings (a collection of characters).

To create a variable, you simply use the `var` keyword and then follow that with the name of your variable.

```javascript
var myName; // creates a place to store a value. Note that no value is stored there
myName = "Robby"; // Now we store a name, Robby, in the variable
console.log(myName); // This will output Robby to the console.
myName = "Abaya"; // We have now overwritten the value that was in our variable with a new value
console.log(myName);
```

In JavaScript, **Typing is dynamic**. Therefore, there is **NO type declaration** before variable names.

```javascript
myName = 120884; // This stores the number 120,884 into our variable
```

### Number

Numbers like in any other languages are really important. Don't forget that a computer is primarly a super calculator. Integers (whole numbers) and floats (numbers with decimals) have the same type : `Number`.

If you want to manipulate numbers, the objects `Number` and `Math` has lots of useful properties and methods. The other useful way to manipulate them is with operators. See reference for more details.

```javascript
// Integer
var i; // first declaration of i (type is undefined)
i = 2; // i is now a integer (type is number)
// Float (Numbers with a decimal)
var j = -5.01;
```

<!-- slide -->

### String

Strings are really simple. Put some text in quotes, and that's a string. The `String` object contains a lot of useful properties and methods, see reference for more details.

```javascript
var a = ""; // The empty string: it has zero characters
var b = "There is no spoon.";
var c = "Only human.";
var d = 'pill="red"';
var e = "Free your mind.";
var f = "You're empty.\nSo are you."; // Type of all variables is string
```

- [regular-expressions.info](http://www.regular-expressions.info/)
- [Online testing tool (gskinner.com)](http://gskinner.com/RegExr/)

### Boolean

A boolean is a value that is either `true` of `false`. You'll see later that other types of variables (Number, String...) can by evaluated as booleans according to some rules.

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var realWorld = false;
var matrix = true; // Type of all variables is boolean
```

```javascript
var a = new Boolean(true); // DO NOT USE : type is object and not boolean
```

- [Boolean reference (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)

<!-- slide -->

### null and undefined

Both `null` and `undefined` are used for **absence of a value**. One is used when the variable **has been initialiazed : `null`**. The other one is used when the variable **has not been initialized : `undefined`**. It can be returned by **function that have no `return` statement**.

```javascript
var neo; // Type is undefined
neo = null; // Type is object
```

- [undefined reference (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined)

<!-- slide : cover -->

## Arrays

An array is an ordered collection of values. Think of the line at a bank; it's an array of people, standing in order. Values can be of different types. Each value is called an element and is positioned in the array with a numeric index starting at zero.

The `Array` object has several properties and methods. The most important property is `length`, it contains the size of the array. See reference for more details.

- [Array reference (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
- [Cool Array Documentation Tool](https://sdras.github.io/array-explorer/)

<!-- slide -->

### Creating

The easiest way to create an array is with square brackets and comma separated values in it. Note that you can create an array with 4 undefined elements, length will be 4.

```javascript
var a = []; // no elements
var b = new Array(); // equivalent to a
var c = [, , , ,]; // 4 elements, all undefined.
var d = new Array(4); // equivalent to c
var e = ["the", 1, true]; // 3 elements of different types
var f = new Array("the", 1, true); // equivalent to e
```

<!-- slide -->

### Reading and writing

Reading and writing in arrays is done with brackets and equal assignment operator. Note that reading from and index that haven't been initialized doesn't generate any errors, it returns `undefined`.

You can insert values in non consecutive indexes, it create a what's called a "sparse array". The length is updated to maximum index + 1.

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var a = ["white"]; // Start with a one-element array
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var b = a[0]; // b => "white"
var c = a[100]; // c => undefined (no error)
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
a[1] = 3.14; // a => ["white", 3.14]
var i = 2;
a[i] = 3; // a => ["white", 3.14, 3]
a[i + 1] = "rabbit"; // a => ["white", 3.14, 3, "rabbit"]
a[a[i]] = a[0]; // a => ["white", 3.14, 3, "white"]
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var d = a.length; // d => 4
```

<!-- slide -->

### Adding and deleting

To add and delete elements from an array, you can use the methods from the `Array` object. There's a lot of useful ones, from simple `pop` and `push` to more complex ones like `splice`. See reference for more details.

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var a = ["follow", "the", "white", "rabbit"];
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var b = a.pop(); // a => ["follow", "the", "white"]
// b => "rabbit"
var c = a.push("RABBIT"); // a => ["follow", "the", "white", "RABBIT"]
// c => 4 (new length)
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var d = a.shift(); // a => ["the", "white", "RABBIT"]
// d => "follow"
var e = a.unshift("FOLLOW"); // a => ["FOLLOW", "the", "white", "RABBIT"]
// e => 4 (new length)
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var f = a.splice(2, 1); // a => ["FOLLOW", "the", "RABBIT"]
// f => "white"
var g = a.splice(1, 2, "ME"); // a => ["FOLLOW", "ME"]
// g => ["the", "RABBIT"]
```

## Operators

Operators are really powerful in JavaScript. Unlike in some other languages like C, operators are not only used to do maths, they are also very useful with strings.

<!-- .useful-links -->

<!-- slide -->

### Arithmetics

Arithmetics operators work the same way as a lot of other programming languages. Note that `+` is used to concatenate strings.

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var a = 6 + 4; // a => 10
var b = -a; // b => -10
var c = 6 - 4; // c => 2
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var d = 1,
  e = ++d; // d and e are both 2
var f = 1,
  g = f++; // f is 2, g is 1
var h = 7,
  i = --h; // h and i are both 6
var j = 7,
  k = j--; // j is 6, k is 7
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var l = 3 * 3; // l => 9
var m = 10 / 3; // m => 3.3333333333333335
var n = 10 % 3; // n => 1
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var o = "Dodge" + " " + "this."; // o => "Dodge this.";
```

<!-- slide -->

### Equality

A particularity of JavaScript is the two kinds of equality comparison : strict and type-converting. Just remember that strict equal `===` compares both types and values and type-converting equal `==` converts one type to the other and just compares values.

Best practice is to always use the strict equality. It prevents a lot of mistakes.

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
// Equality
var a = "2" == 2; // a => true
var b = "2" != 2; // b => false
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
// Strict equality
var c = "2" === 2; // c => false
var d = "2" !== 2; // d => true
```

- [Comparison operators reference (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators)

<!-- slide -->

### Comparison

Like arithmetics, comparison operators work the same way as a lot of other programming languages. Note that these operators can be used to compare string.

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var a = 2 > 2; // a => false
var b = 2 <= 2; // b => true
var c = "2" >= 2; // c => true
var d = 2 < 2; // d => false
var e = 2 <= 2; // e => true
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var f = "abc" < "def"; // f => true
```

<!-- .useful-links -->

### Logical

```javascript
var a = true && false; // a => false
var b = true || false; // b => true
var c = !true; // c => false
```

### Assignement

Assignement operators saves you some place and can improve code readability. Use them carefuly!

```javascript
var a = 1,
  b = 0;
a += b; // a = a + b
a -= b; // a = a - b
a *= b; // a = a * b
a /= b; // a = a / b
a %= b; // a = a % b
```

- [Assignment operators reference (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Assignment_Operators)

### `in`

The `in` operator is used to verify if a property is specified on an object. Be careful when you use it.

```javascript
var a = [1, 9, 4];
var b = 2 in a; // b => true
var c = 9 in a; // c => false
var d = length in a; // d => true
```

- [in operator reference (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Special/in)

<!-- slide -->

### `typeof`

`typeof` is used at compilation time to verify the type of a variable.

```javascript
var a = 3;
var b = typeof a; // b => "number"
var c = "";
var d = typeof c; // d => "string"
var e = true;
var f = typeof e; // f => "boolean"
```

<!-- slide : cover -->

## Type conversions

JavaScript is not statically typed but you can determine the type of a variable at execution time. Conversion from one type to another can be done explicitly or implicitly. It's really important to understand implicit ones, they can help you to avoid strange behaviours and bugs.

<!-- slide -->

### Explicit

Explicit conversions can for example help you to convert a string to a number. Note that even if integers and floats are both number, using `parseInt` on a float removes the decimals and makes it by definition an integer.

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
// to Number
var a = Number("10"); // a => 10
var b = Number(false); // b =>  0
var c = parseInt("10", 10); // c => 10
var d = parseInt(10.2); // d => 10
var e = parseFloat("10.2"); // e => 10.2
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
// to String
var a = String(false); // a => "false"
var b = String(10); // b => "10"
var c = String(10.2); // c => "10.2"
var d = (10).toString(); // d => "10"
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
// to Boolean
var a = Boolean(10); // a => true
var b = Boolean(0); // b => false
var c = Boolean(0.3); // c => true
var d = Boolean("true"); // d => true
```

<!-- slide -->

### Implicit

There's a lot of ways to convert a string to a number. Performances can differ a lot depending on the technique used and the plateform. A shorter syntax is often prefered for bandwith uses.

Look carefully how the `+` operator behaves with strings and numbers.

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
// to Number
var a = +"10"; // a => 10
var b = "10" >> 0; // b => 10
var c = "10" * 1; // c => 10
var d = ~~"10"; // d => 10
var e = "2" * "5"; // e => 10 (both strings converts to number)
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
// to String
var a = 10 + "10"; // a => "1010"
var b = "10" + "10"; // b => "1010"
var c = 10 + " agents"; // c => "10 agents"
var d = 10 + 10 + " agents"; // d => "20 agents"
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
// to Boolean
var a = !!"morpheus"; // a => true
var b = !!""; // b => false
var c = !!"0"; // c => true
var d = !!"1"; // d => true
```

### Summary

Here's a little summary of conversions results. Pay attention especially to "anything to boolean" conversions, it can save you some time when used in `if` conditions.

## Statements

<!-- slide -->

### Conditionnal

In JavaScript, conditionnal statements behaves pretty much like in other common languages.

Note that the conditional ternary operator should only be used in simple cases. It is often use for variable assignment and its usage is synonym of shorter syntax and readability. If you think it doesn't make your code better, use a classic `if`.

#### if/else

In this case, normal equality is handy, used with `null`, it can test null || `undefined`.

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
if (username == null) {
  // if username is null or undefined,
  username = "Trinity"; // define it
}
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
if (bulletCount === 1) {
  bulletCount += " bullet";
} else {
  bulletCount += " bullets";
}
```

var user = name == null ? "default user" : name;
```

<!-- .useful-links -->

- [If...else reference (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)

<!-- slide -->

#### switch

Switch usage is often advised when you have too much if statements. Don't forget the `break` keyword. Note that you can use string unlike some other languages.

```javascript
var quote;
switch (characterName) {
  case "Smith":
    quote = "Goodbye, Mr. Anderson...";
    break;
  case "Neo":
    quote = "I know kung fu.";
    break;
  default:
    quote = "What is the Matrix?";
    break;

#### for...in loops

for..in loops are used to iterate over properties of an object.

Array indexes are just enumerable properties with integer names. Therefore, for...in loops could be used to enumerate elements of an array.

Because of performance issues and in order to avoid bugs, use classic for loops instead of for..in with arrays.

```javascript
var a = [123, 456, 789];
for (var i in a) {
  // DO NOT use with arrays
  doSomething(a[i]);
}
```

<!-- .list.incremental.warning -->

### Integration

The best way to integrate JavaScript in a web page is through a JavaScript file and a link to it in your HTML page. The link can be placed in `head` or `body` it really depends on the situation.

```html5
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="myscript1.js"></script>   <!-- unobstrusive JS -->
    <script> // some code </script>        <!-- REALLY BAD PRACTICE -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="myscript2.js"></script>   <!-- better unobstrusive JS -->
  </body>
</html>
```

<!-- .list.incremental.warning -->

**Avoid direct JavaScript in HTML documents**, it's a bad practice. It **breaks the structure/behaviour separation**. **Code can't be reused on other pages**. It also prevents you from having a changeable and maintenable code.

Putting your scripts at the just before the `</body>` is a good practice. We'll see that in details in performances lesson.

### Browser objects

Every JavaScript plateform/environment adds objects with global scope. They're meant to provide helpful features to developers. In web browsers the most important ones are : `document` and `window`.

Another object is present but only in modern browsers : `console`. Since it's not standard, implementations may differ, see references for more details. Remember that older browsers don't support it, so don't let `console.log('foo')` etc... in production code.

Even if JavaScript has been standardized to ECMAScript, each platform doesn't always support all the latest features. You should **always read documentation** and **look up if it's supported**. You should also **test your code over the different browsers** of your audience.

There's often two (or more) ways to do the same thing in JavaScript. It's not because two browsers have feature X and Y that they implemented it the same way. Performances can be very different. As always : read documentation and test...

# Appendix

## Definition & properties

JavaScript is a scripting language that supports multiple programming styles. It differs from other languages such as C++, Java or PHP with its dynamic behaviour, its first-class functions and its prototype-based inheritance.

JavaScript lovers consider these features as the force of the language. It's very common for people who try to write JavaScript like they write code in other languages to hate it. Don't make this mistake!

## Usages

<!-- .list.incremental -->

Even if it was originally designed to work in a **browser environment**, JavaScript is now used on several **different platforms**. Here are a few examples :

- Web server
- Browser addons/extensions
- Mobile applications
- Databases consoles
- OpenOffice scripts/macros
- Java applications

### Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators help programmers to use numbers like sequences of 32 bits (zeros and ones). It's not always easy to understand what's going on but it's very useful, for example if you're implementing bitmasks.

```javascript
var a = 42 & 2; // a =>          2  (AND)
var b = 7 | 2; // b =>          2  (OR)
var c = 7 ^ 2; // c =>          7  (XOR)
var d = ~8; // d =>         -7  (NOT)
var e = 1 << 3; // e =>          8  (Shift left)
var f = 8 >> 2; // f =>          2  (Shift right)
var g = -1 >> 2; // g =>         -1
var h = -1 >>> 2; // h => 1073741823  (Shift right with zero fill)
```

## Variable scope

The scope of a variable is the region of your code in which it is defined. JavaScript has a very specific way of handling scope. Scope can be altered by `function`s and the `var` keyword.

Note that statements like `if`, `for`... doesn't change scope of variables. See reference for more details.

### Global vs. local

Variables declared outside of any function are defined everywhere in your code. They are considered global.

Variables declared inside a function are defined only within the function body. They are considered local to the function.

```javascript
var name = "Andy"; // not in a function => variable is global

function foo() {
  var lastName = "WACHOWSKI"; // inside a function => variable is local
  return name + " " + lastname; // can access global variable "name"
}
foo();

var a = lastName; // ReferenceError lastName is not defined
// can not access local variable "lastName"
```

### Don't forget `var`

If you ommit the `var` keyword inside a function, the variable is automatically considered global. It can have serious side effects. It's considered bad practice, you shouldn't use this.

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var i = 1;
function foo() {
  var i = 3;
}
foo();
var a = i; // a => 1
```

<!-- .incremental -->

```javascript
var i = 1;
function foo() {
  i = 3; // no var keyword !!! :-(
  j = 4; // no var keyword !!! :-(
}
foo();
var a = i; // a => 3
var b = j; // b => 4
```
